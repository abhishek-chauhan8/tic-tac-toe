# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game can be played by two players on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns to mark a space on the grid with their symbol (either 'X' or 'O'). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

### Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Play against a friend.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use controls and intuitive layout.
- **Winner Detection**: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
- **Draw Detection**: Identifies when the game is a draw/tied   .

## How to Play


1. Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty square.
2. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) is the winner.
3. If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw/tied.
